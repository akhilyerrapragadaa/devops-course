## Description:
Chaos engineering is becoming very concrete need for many organizations these days. The operations team that is responsible for managing the application in production, can inject controlled perturbation to see how the application is reacting to it. The ultimate target here is to make the application resilient to any kind of failures in production systems. If any fragile situations are found when implementing chaos engineering in production, the operations team can update the development team on the vulnerability. The development team can work on the stated issues and can send the fixed package to operations team and the devops cycle continuous. Below provides the information regarding the areas we would like to cover during our presentation.

 -Introduction to chaos engineering and it's principles. 
 -Comparison between failure injection and chaos engineering.
 -Performance evaluation of a spring application using chaos monkey and its drawbacks.
 -Tools used for chaos engineering. We will delve into the different use cases for them and the different   categories of tools that are available now.
 -Application level chaos engineering with "Chaos Machine".
 -A deeper look into its technical implementation.
