## Description:
Experimenting on a software system in production environment in order to build confidence in system stability is becoming a key concept in large organizations. With each iteration in devops tool kit, with releases, we are increasing the vulnerability of the system for a failure. Injecting chaos engineering in monitoring phase of the devops will make sure that each iteration will be more resilient to failures. Below are some of the key areas we would like to cover in our presentation.

•	Chaos engineering and its principles.
•	Tools available for chaos engineering and their differences.
•	Failure Injection vs Chaos engineering.
•	Chaos Monkey with spring applications and its drawbacks.
•	Chaos Machine and its principles.
•	Chaos Machine and its architecture.
